# Mechanical Drawings

This folder contains drawings created by me (Hazen) intended to provide
input to the proper mechanical design.  DXF file geometry was extracted
either from my OpenSCAD "toy" model or PCB layouts.

```cooling_plate.dxf``` and ```cooling_plate_anno.dxf```
: The cooling plate.  Outer dimensions are approximate.  Thickness limited
to stacking height of the connectors (inner surface of PMT board to backplane
board is 8.4mm).  Cutouts are shown for Samtec ```MW-34-03-G-D-245-065-ES```
connectors with shrouds.  Actual shroud dimensions: 36 x 4.32mm.
Geometry extracted from OpenSCAD.
