# EMPHATIC Mechanics

This repository contains a preliminary 3D model for the electronics and enclosure for EMPHATIC (folder ```Eric3D```).  It may be a good place to keep the "final" mechanical design files and drawings.

There is a set of DXF drawings in ```Eric3D/dwgs``` which represent the proposed dimensions of the electronic components.
